mtgox-socket-client
===========================

A Node.js Socket.io client for the MtGox bitcoin exchange Streaming API. This is a port from [dlanod](https://github.com/dlanod)'s https://github.com/dlanod/node-mtgox-websocket-client (the WebSocket API is now deprecated in favor of Socket.io).

Installation
------------

$ npm install mtgox-socket-client

$ node demo.js

You may also need to put your API keys inside of 'keys.js' if you want to access the 'client' channel (e.g. your personal trades).

Example Use
------------

```javascript
var MtGoxClient = require('mtgox-client').MtGoxClient;

var client = new MtGoxClient({channels: {client: true, trade: true}});

/* Show the trade message every time someone makes a trade */
client.on("trade",function(message) {
	console.log("Got trade message from mtgox!",message);	
});

/* Show the trade message every there is a client-specific action (buy, sell, etc) */
client.on("other",function(message) {
	console.log("Got client-specific message from mtgox!",message);	
});
```
